# GPN

### Overview

This repository relates to a research idea about stabilizing of generative neural networks training.

Suggested approach is called Generative Predictive Networks (GPN). It is a combination of two components:
* Similarly to GANs, there are discriminator and generator;
* Unlikely to GANs, they are not trained simultaneously â€” discriminator is trained in a predictive learning setup and then generator is trained.

To the best of the author knowledge, this approach is novel. Any references to existing literature about the topic are highly appreciated.
